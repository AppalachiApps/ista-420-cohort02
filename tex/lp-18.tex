    \section{Course Project}

    Project evaluations. Prepare a critical evaluation of the projects of the other two groups. Bu ``critical evaluation'' I mean that you should examine the project in detail, identify the areas that are deficient and offer suggestions for improvements, and identify areas that are well done explaining why you think that the work was well done. The purpose of this is to give the other students the benefit of your experience, as well as showing you alternatives to do the same thing you have been working on.

    Email your evaluations to the students in the other projects and to me as well. Each of you owe me two evaluations. These are to be considered sensitive and should not be disclosed to third parties or uploaded to public repositories.
