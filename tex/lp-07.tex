    \begin{enumerate}
        \item In your own words, what is a \textit{subquery}?
        \item What is the difference between a subquery that returns a single value and one that returns multiple values? Give examples of where you would use each kind of subquery.

    \section{In Class Exercises}

You will have ten querys to write. Use Sqlite with the NorthWind database. Submit your deliverable on your Github site. Your responses are due at 11:00 a.m.

%    \begin{enumerate}
%        \item What products do we have that cost more than the average price of all of our products?
%        \item What is our highest priced product? Use a subquery for the answer.

    \section{Graded Labs}

    No graded labs today. We will review the graded exercises. You will self-grade your papers and \textit{email} me your grade. This will help solidify your grasp of the concepts we have covered, especially while the questions are still fresh in your mind.  

    \section{Course Project}


        \subsection{Software Engineering}

        Testing, unit tests, integration tests, and regression tests.
        
        \subsection{Version Control}

        TBA

        \subsection{Project Assignment}

        Your project assignment for today is testing. Write a SQL script that tests the implementation you did yesterday. You should test against the requirements specification that you wrote Monday. Test to see whether or not your implementation satisfies the requirements. Your deliverable should be a script file. You should also comment your script file to reference the particular requirement that your query tests. Note that a single requirement may result in many tests. Note whether your implementation satisfies the requirement.
